                        <p>Wow. Happosai. He’s difficult to describe, though in my <a href="https://421a.moe/almost-none-of-the-main-ranma-%c2%bd-characters-are-good-people/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">post about the show’s characters over on 421a.MOE</a>, I mention that I thought Happosai was the most 
                        honest character in the series. Sure, he lies, but he lies about stuff and not about himself (generally). He is who he is, and he not only accepts that, but 
                        takes pride in it. Now, for some non-editorial information:</p>
                        <p>Happosai is the founder of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. He is the one who trained Soun and Genma. He also had them take the rap for him when he 
                        would steal things, do a dine and dash, that kind of stuff. Apparently, that helps develop discipline, or something to that effect.</p>
                        <p>One day, Soun and Genma got Happosai all drunk, put him in a barrel, stuck him in a cave with enough explosives that would make the director of Homeland 
                        Security scream, and blew him up. (Happosai, not the DHS director…)</p>
                        <p>Well, X years later, Happosai comes to the Tendo dojo. Apparently, a quarter ton of TNT was not enough. Happosai does not hold a grudge though. He just moved 
                        on in and steals ladies underwear every night, much to the chagrin of Soun (and the greater Nerima area).</p>
