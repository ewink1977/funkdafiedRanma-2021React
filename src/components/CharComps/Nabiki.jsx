                        Out of all the character pages I have recoded, this was the only one where I felt what I had written about the character was too offensive to keep. And if 
                        you have seen some of the other pages, I have a high bar when it comes to things that I say that I consider ‘too offensive’. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I have a ton of appreciation for Nabiki. She’s smart, she’s clever, and she’s someone who would be awesome to have on your side. However you have to be 
                        careful as she’s also the kind of person who would switch sides for the right price.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You might consider that rough, and while of course I think she cares deeply for Akane, Kasumi, and to a certain extent, Ranma, she also knows that 
                        they are strong enough that a little blackmail isn’t going to hurt them. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I am not sure if that’s a positive character trait, or a negative one. It just is. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Going solely by the anime, I am not sure what interests, outside of money and being snarky she has, but on at least one occasion she is seen reading manga. 
                        I must assume she has other hobbies more appropriate for a 17-year-old girl and not a Wall Street investment banker, but I have no idea what those would be.

                    My name is Nabiki Tendo. I'm 17 years old.

                    Erin's partially right. I do strive to obtain as much capital. After all, capital is power, and power is everything, wouldn’t you agree? You 
                    know, Erin, if you'd like I have some really nice pictures of Shampoo I think you'd like. <em>(Erin whips out his - checkbook)</em> Sorry hun, 
                    cash only. <em>(Erin whimpers due to the emptiness of his pockets)</em> Sucks to be you, eh? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I hang around Kuno because he has a nice stash of cash. maybe if I can ever get him to get over my sister and Ranma I can pick him up for myself. 
                    Until then, well there's no law against exploiting the stupid, is there?
