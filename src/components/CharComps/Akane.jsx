                        <p>Akane Tendo. Where do I begin? Let's start with the fact that in my motherland of Illinois, and several other states in the US, 
                        Akane would have been already tried and convicted of domestic violence, and would be spending many, many, many, many months in a 
                        woman's correctional institution.</p>
                        <p>But, I shouldn't go anywhere with this. On my old website, I got a REALLY nasty mail when I referred to Ranma Â½ as 'a show that makes 
                        spouse abuse funny!' I fear that they did a search on spouse abuse and found my site by mistake. For the record, domestic abuse is 
                        never funny. Except on Ranma. Look, if I had a girlfriend and she pulled a hammer out of nowhere and hit me with it you'd laugh, so 
                        shut up and don't judge.</p>
                        <p>Now that I've wasted a couple of paragraphs, I love to try and dissect Akane's brain. She tries even harder than Ranma to deny her 
                        feelings. We need to get her a 13 step program. (Learn to cook needs to be in there somewhere.) Actually, I think if she didn't 
                        improvise she would make a good cook. Going back to what I was saying, Akane is very complex. She's bright, yet stupid (ahem - P-Chan?). 
                        She's a skilled martial artist and thinks she takes it seriously, but she doesn't. Breaking bricks does nothing but generate hairline 
                        fractures.</p>
                        <p>I also want to point out the top picture is from such a great OAV. Akane can be so freaking sexy when she wants to be. Like, insanely 
                        sexy. When. She. Wants. To. Be.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I like my orange tabby. (RIP Friskey Cat...)</p>

                    <p>I'm Akane Tendo. Age 16.</p>
                    <p>I don't love Ranma. How can anyone love that insensitive jerk? Your logic is flawed. You will be assimilated.</p>
                    <p>I have been engaged to Ranma by my father. It's so we can take over the dojo. I also have that moron Kuno chasing after me all the time.</p>
                    <p>I used to have a crush on the family doctor, Dr. Tofu. But I gave up on that once I came to terms with the fact that he is madly in love 
                    with my sister Kasumi.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy sports and hanging out with my friends. And for your information, breaking bricks is an important part of my training. But that 
                    is not all I do, thank you very much.</p>
