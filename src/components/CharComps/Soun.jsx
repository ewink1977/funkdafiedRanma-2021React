                        <p>Soun. The (maybe inadvertant) comic relief of the anime. I love this silly S-O-B. There have been times where he has made me laugh so hard, I started 
                        to bawl, just like Soun!</p>
                        <p>Soun is the father to Akane, Nabiki, and Kasumi. he is the owner of the Dojo and Genma's best friend. Soun's wife died when the kids were at an early age. 
                        I am not sure exactly when it was, but I am willing to bet that Kasumi was 12 or 13. Soun has not really gotten over it. Anytime she is brought up Soun 
                        reverts into super-sobbing mode.</p>
                        <p>Soun also loves to hide when he is in trouble. Especially when that trouble involves his and Genma's master, Happosai. He knows that he should kick 
                        Happosai out of the house, but he is too scared.</p>

                    <p>I'm Soun Tendo. I'm old.</p>
                    <p>I am the father of Akane, Nabiki, and Kasumi. I am also the owner and proprietor of the Tendo Dojo. I am a student of the Anything Goes 
                    School of Martial Arts. I arranged with my old friend Genma that his son would marry one of my daughters so that the school would 
                    continue after we were gone.</p>
                    <p>Erin is right. I still get emotional when it comes to my dear departed wife. I miss her deeply. I don't think there is anything wrong with
                    that. <em>*Pause 46 seconds for sobbing*</em></p>
                    <p>Anyway, I don't turn into anything when wet, except for a wet Tendo! <em>*Pause 11 seconds for uncontrollable laughter*</em> I like 
                    playing Shoji with Saotome and helping my daughter Akane learn the art.</p>
