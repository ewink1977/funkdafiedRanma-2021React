                        <p>Just a listing and a picture of some of the less active characters, or ones that I really don't care too much about.</p>
                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Mousse</h3>
                        <p>Mousse is, in the immortal words of Red Forman on That 70's Show, a dumbass.  Mousse is even more obsessed with Shampoo than I am, which is hard to believe. 
                        He tries everything he can think of to win her over, but he constantly fails. This proves that persistence does NOT pay off! He has been trying to win 
                        Shampoo over since they were both little kids playing in the mud. Well, Mousse was playing till Shampoo knocked him over. Mousse is also blind without his 
                        glasses. The worst thing is that he forgets that they are on his head most of the time. He ends up talking to animals and statues thinking they are different 
                        people. Mousse is also a master of hidden weapons. His weapon of choice is the duck shaped potty trainer.</p>

                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Dr. Tofu</h3>
                        <p>Dr. Tofu is Nerima's resident chiropractor. Apparently, in Japan you can be a general practitioner as a chiropractor since he takes care of the Tendo family for 
                        things more complicated than just a stiff neck. </p>
                        <p>He is particularly good at what he does. He is also a martial arts master, even though he does not look the part. He is very skilled when it comes to 
                        pressure points. Word to the wise though. When Kasumi's in the vicinity do not let him try to do anything to you. He goes goog-a-ly, as poor Ranma's neck 
                        learned one day. The good doctor is very much in love with her, and his glasses get all steamed up. He then seems more like Mousse than anyone else.</p>
                        <p>Tofu has gotten Ranma out of quite a few binds with his pressure points and what not including a temporary cure for the cat’s tongue and assisting with 
                        the repair of Akane's memory when Shampoo washed them all away. Granted he did not do much, but it's the thought that counts.</p>

                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Hikaru Gosunkugi</h3>
                        <p>Poor Akane must have some sort of loser attracting pheromone emanating from her. This dork is really into Voodoo and tries to use it to fend off bullies 
                        and win Akane from Ranma. I do not really know a lot about him. He does not show up until the sixth season in the anime, but he is there from the start in 
                        the manga.</p>
                        <hr className="sep-hr" />
                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Tsubasa Kurenai</h3>
                        <p>Tsubasa is a weird one. He is he who dresses as a she to get Ukyou to fall in love with her. Well, I don't know if that's why he cross dresses, but he 
                        does cross dress. He also wears mailboxes and soda machines (no, that's NOT a typo!) to fight and win Ukyou's heart. Hey Tsubasa Rodman - try dressing as a 
                        boy and then maybe she will find you cool? Then again, Ukyou dresses as a boy. Wouldn't that be an odd wedding? Ukyou in a tux and Tsubasa in a wedding dress. 
                        I smell a Jerry Springer episode. It’s particularly interesting because neither of them suffers from gender dysphoria – Tsubasa seems happy being male and 
                        Ukyou seems happy being female. </p>
                        <p>Whatever, I’m not going to kink-shame.</p>
                        <hr className="sep-hr" />
                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Nadoka Saotome</h3>
                        <p>Nadoka rocks! She is Ranma's Miz-Ommy. (Mom) She's a great cook. She is not so happy about Ranma being gone though. We also learn that because of Genma's 
                        promise to raise Ranma to be a man among men that the curse would allegedly cause their demise. </p>
                        <p>Apparently, Nadoka is going to make them commit suicide over it. Sounds a little farfetched to me. I could see making Genma do it, but not Ranma. Whenever 
                        Nadoka visits the Tendos, Ranma and Genma must stay in their cursed form and pretend to be just a girl and her Panda.</p>
                        <hr className="sep-hr" />
                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">Hinako Ninomiya</h3>
                        <p>Hinako is a teacher at Ranma et all's school. At first glance she looks more like she should be a student at the elementary school, but do not be fooled. 
                        She is the delinquent neutralizer. She has an attack which sucks Ki out of you which turns her into one of the series' big boobie'd hotties!</p>
                        <p>She shows up in the OAV, Like Water for Ranma and to my knowledge is not in any of the regular series episodes.</p>
                        <hr className="sep-hr" />
                        <h3 className="misc-char-head">What about...</h3>
                        <p>Did I forget your favorite character? Sorry. Send me a note and I will try and add more. I may also expand the site more over the coming months, so follow 
                        me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/erinwinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a> for updates!</p>
