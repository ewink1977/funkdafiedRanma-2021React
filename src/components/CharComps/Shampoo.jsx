                        <p>Okay - Shampoo is, for lack of a better term, the bomb-diggity. Shampoo has so many great qualities, and I would have to say that I am 
                        madly in love with her.</p>
                        <p>Before you write or send the men in white after me, yes I know she's an anime character. Let it go and let me live in my world, okay? As an 
                        interesting aside, I wrote this back in the days where having a waifu was less accepted than it is now, yet I am still not sure my love of her 
                        is okay...</p>
                        <p>Anyway. Shampoo is from an Amazon tribe in China. In case you haven't checked out the engagement chart (and shame on you if you haven't) Ranma is engaged to 
                        Shampoo. After kicking her ass in a tournament in her village, Shampoo was sent to Japan to kill Ranma (she was female at the time of aforementioned ass-kicking). 
                        Well, she met male Ranma, and he accidentally ended up kicking her ass. (Yes, I like saying ass, but it is only because Shampoo has such a nice one!) Well, 
                        now because of Amazon law she had to marry Ranma. She also fell in love with Ranma. Now, still not knowing they were one in the same (male and female Ranma) 
                        she was still hell bent on killing girl Ranma. Ranma finally told her his secret, only with a twist. Ranma told Shampoo that his female form was his real form.</p>
                        <p>Torn and very, very upset, Shampoo returned to China. Because she failed to kill Ranma and failed to marry Ranma (OUCH! Brain freeze!) her grandmother took 
                        her to Jusenkyo to train. Well, I suppose you know where this is going. Yup, Shampoo fell into one of the springs. Spring of drowned cat to be exact.</p>
                        <p>Now, Shampoo mailed herself to Ranma in her cat form as a present. A cute little twist is that Ranma is afraid of cats. While she was a cat she learned that 
                        Ranma's true form was male, so now she's all over Ranma like a fly at a poop convention. I don't have anything to top that icky analogy, so let's end this 
                        here.</p>
