                        <p>When it comes to Ukyou, I am not sure if age has just changed my opinion on her or just all 2D women in general, but I have gone from thinking that yes, 
                        she is cute, to finding her gorgeous. She’s still second behind Shampoo (not that I am the kind of pig who would rank women……………), but she’s amazingly 
                        beautiful.</p>
                        <p>Ukyou was Ranma's childhood friend. Ranma all throughout his childhood thought that Ukyou was a boy. I can understand the mistake at that age. However, 
                        when Ranma met up with Ukyou in the not-so-distant past, he still thought she was a dude. Now either Ranma is a lot more stupid than we originally though, 
                        or Ukyou was using one hell of a corset. Regardless, as you should obviously be able to tell from the picture to the left, Ukyou is a girl.</p>
                        <p>She is an okonomiyaki chef, and she runs her own restaurant. She is one of Ranma fiancées. If you did not know that you should read the engagement chart 
                        and then return here.</p>
                        <p>Ukyou attends school with Ranma and company. She is in Ranma and Akane's class. She for whatever reason wears a boy’s uniform to school. That's cool though. 
                        I have seen her dressed up real ‘girly’ like, with one of those terrible, frilly ‘80s dresses, and she looks much better dressed as a boy. Except when she is 
                        topless in an apron. MEOW! (Not that I am the kind of pig who would judge her based on her looks……………….)</p>

                    <p>I am Ukyou Konji. I'm 16 years old.</p>
                    <p>As you may or may not know, Ranma-honey is my fiancée. I am the cute fiancée; I don't care what Erin says. <em>(I called you gorgeous…)</em> I was supposed 
                    to be raised with Ranma by his father, but the jackass took off with my family's okonomiyaki cart and ditched me. I'm not mad though.</p>
                    <p>I do indeed run my own shop. I make good money from it, at least until Ranma honey comes in and eats up all my profits! That's okay though! Anything for him!</p>
                    <p>And for the record, I DO NOT LIKE RYOUGA!</p>
