                        This page is about another third of the Insane Kuno Posse (yeah, I thought of that on my own!), Kodachi Kuno!

                        Kodachi goes to a private girl’s school. She is nuts dude. And to top it off, she is just as stupid as her brother. She also has seen Ranma's 
                        transformation, but she doesn't realize that her 'darling Ranma' and the 'wicked Pig Tailed Girl' are one in the same. What do you expect though 
                        from a gene pool you could probably wade across?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Kodachi is infatuated with Ranma. She hates Akane and female Ranma with a passion. She seems like she is good at rhythmic gymnastics, but she is always 
                        cheating so it’s hard to know for sure how she would fare in a fair match. She also likes to use potions and powders, so if she ever offers you something 
                        to eat, no matter how good it looks, I'd decline.

                        On a historical side note, you can see her original voice actor regularly on Stargate SG1. She's Dr. Frasier!

                    Greetings. I am Kodachi Kuno. I am 16 years old.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I notice that the treacherous Ewink only has one picture of me on this internet site. I am the Black Rose, Kodachi Kuno! I demand at a minimum of three 
                    pictures, each one more beautiful than the last! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I am in love with my darling Ranma and he loves me. His father also adores me. I will free Ranma from the grasps of the treacherous Akane Tendo soon, 
                    then we can live together, happily ever after! <em>(Insert maniacal laugh and a blizzard of black rose pedals here…)</em>
