                        <p>Kasumi! Praise Xenu, I love this girl! She is so sweet. She can be a bit ditzy at times, but that’s not a negative trait, in fact 
                        I think it makes her even cuter. </p>
                        <p>Seriously. Kasumi rocks. She is a great cook; she treats people wonderfully and she's assumed the role of the mother in the Tendo household. 
                        Despite having this motherly aura about her, she can still get Dr. Tofu's motor running! I wonder what would happen if Tofu had contacts? 
                        Maybe he should try LAZIK?</p>
                        <p>Anyway. Kasumi is the only one of the Tendo girls who has finished high school. Like I said, she has assumed the role of the mother, and does all the 
                        cooking, cleaning, and other stuff Japanese mothers do. This is another one of those things that really dates the show and makes it more difficult for 
                        allegedly woke people like myself to write about, but it’s important to remember things are a product of their time and culture. </p>
                        <p>Interesting side note, Kasumi is the only one of the people who know about Ranma's curse and still calls Ranma 'she' when she is a female. Happosai does 
                        it, but he doesn't count. Why not? Cause I say so, that's why. Also he does it for hentai reasons, unlike Kasumi who is a pure as a pair of Happosai’s 
                        stolen panties.</p>

                    <p>Hello and thank you for taking time to read about me! My name is Kasumi Tendo! I'm 19 years old.</p>
                    <p>I did take over mother's role after she died. She taught me all that I know about cooking and everything. I am trying to pass that knowledge on to Akane 
                    so that she will be a good wife for Ranma. <em>(I'm trying SO hard not to laugh!)</em> It's not funny, Erin. She tries so hard.</p>
                    <p>I have several interests. I am extremely interested in medicine. I enjoy books that Dr. Tofu lends me. He acts so funny sometimes.</p>
