                        <p>If you are familiar with the show that one word says it all. If not, let me explain him. Genma is an irresponsible, wimpy, un-honorable thief. He has 
                        proved on multiple occasions that he will do anything for food, even if it means sacrificing his own son. (See the engagement chart for more details.) 
                        Genma is also a victim of the cursed springs. Ranma knocked his ass into the spring of drowned panda. Genma has come to terms with his cursed form and 
                        uses it to his advantage. Examples - when he's in trouble he changes so he can't speak.</p>
                        <p>I have pretty much given up on figuring Genma out. It is obvious he has his own agenda. Once when Kodachi was pressuring Ranma for marriage, Genma 
                        accepted her as his daughter once she began waving money and food at him. He also did not seem to mind when it looked like girl Ranma would have to end 
                        up marrying that French freak.</p>
                        <p>Genma thinks of only 3 people. He, Himself and Him.</p>

                    <p>Hello. I'm Genma Saotome. I'm old.</p>
                    <p>First I have that ingrate son of mine, now the ingrate webmaster. <em>(Oh please.)</em> Erin, I care about the school and the art. I do 
                    what I must do to make sure the school goes on once I have passed on. The school, and Ranma, are my legacy.</p>
                    <p>Everything I have done has been to help the school and to train Ranma. Do you really think that he would be the man he is if I hadn't taken him away 
                    from his mother? Of course not. <em>(He's not exactly wrong here, but I won't say he's right either...)</em></p>
                    <p>I enjoy playing Shoji with Soun. I also enjoy a nap in the sun. And there are also my morning sparing sessions with Ranma.</p>
