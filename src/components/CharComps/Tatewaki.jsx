                        It is hard to decide who's more of the comic relief. Soun or this poor fellow. Kuno is pretty much a moron. I am sure that if he wasn't rich, he would have 
                        had to ride the short yellow bus to school. Another problematic joke I am leaving in because apparently, I hate myself.

                        <p>
                        Kuno, even though he has seen the transformation a million times plus one, still does not realize that Ranma and the pig tailed girl are the same. But, I suppose, that's part of his charm.

                        <p>
                        Let's see... relevant information... Kuno is Ranma and company's upperclassman. His father is the principal, and his sister goes to a private girl’s school. 
                        She is nuts too, for your information. The principal is also a lunatic, making it blatantly obvious that fruitcake-ism is hereditary.

                        <p>
                        My favorite thing about Kuno is the fact he is the Ranma world king of one-liners (well, okay two or three liners). In my fanfic, Moon Trek, Kuno is one of my 
                        favorite character to write for, which now makes me sad that he was only in a three of the ten stories. Sigh… So many regerts.

                    Greetings. My name is the great Tatewaki Kuno, known to the students of Furinkan High School as The Blue Thunder. Age, 17. You may now be seated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I am the captain of Furinkan's Kendo club. I am also the students spiritual leader. <em>(Oh my God, where did that come from?)</em> SILENCE WRETCHED WEBMASTER!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I have the hearts of both Akane Tendo and The Pig-Tailed Girl, but I cannot decide which I love more! Also, that cretin, Ranma Saotome, and his evil sorcerer 
                    ways keeps me from my loves. Never fear, I, The Blue Thunder will liberate you both from his evil grasps! (Insert patented Kuno cackle here.)
