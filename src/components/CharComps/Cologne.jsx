                        <p>The female version of Happosai. Only without the panty raiding. And a little bit smarter. And she is not a thief. Okay, she is 
                        nothing like Happosai, except that she is about the same height and she's about the same age.</p>
                        <p>Cologne is Shampoo's great grandmother. She insinuates that she never got married, so one can only assume that Shampoo's grandmother 
                        was a love child. No one mentions Shampoo's mother either. I might have to do some research on that!</p>
                        <p>Cologne is an exceptionally good martial artist. She taught Ranma the chestnuts over an open fire technique and Ryouga the breaking point. 
                        She also trained Shampoo, and I believe is the one who knocked her into Spring of Drowned Cat.</p>
                        <p>Cologne runs the cat cafe. I think she does other things as well. Not sure what though.</p>

                    <p>My name is Cologne. As mentioned, I am Shampoo's great-grandmother. I taught Shampoo how to fight. I am also helping her in the quest to get my 
                    son in law. <em>(Ranma to those not paying attention...)</em></p>
                    <p>I almost had him once, but he beat me with the cat fist. Something good came out of his father ruining his life! Now Erin you can forget about Shampoo.
