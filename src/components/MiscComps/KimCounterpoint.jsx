                            This essay was made for one reason. It is to show the relationship
                            between Mousse and Shampoo truthfully and to show exactly HOW and
                            WHY they get together with facts from the manga not the anime. I
                            am not saying who should or who could but who obviously will get
                            together. I am sick of people saying that Shampoo hates Mousse's
                            guts because that's just not true. Mousse knows that Shampoo is
                            rejecting him and is most likely just mad that Ranma treats
                            Shampoo bad and KNOWS he might have a chance because of that. The
                            reason I am only focusing on the manga is because Rumiko Takahashi
                            made the manga, NOT the anime and Takahashi's input is the ONLY
                            one that matters in the end. Please email me with ANY questions or

                            Ahh, where to start? I guess I should tell you first and foremost
                            that this essay is all supported by fact by the manga and
                            everything else is just logical Ranmaverse sense. But I'll start
                            with saying this Shampoo does not hate Mousse. She has shown over
                            and over again she cares for him. Now let me explain WHY Shampoo
                            acts the way she does to Mousse. She is cold and she is mean
                            because she HAS to be. The reason is simple and the reason is the
                            Amazon law. She HAS to marry Ranma. Shampoo's relationship with
                            Ranma is based on an Amazon law and that's flatly it. Shampoo does
                            not want to marry Ranma for any other reason and the manga has not
                            given us any reason Shampoo likes Ranma besides the fact Ranma
                            beat her up. Shampoo is constantly rejected by Ranma and she has
                            no real reason to want to marry him besides the Amazon laws. So
                            after Ranma marries Akane as the manga says they will Shampoo will
                            not have to keep caring about Ranma like Ukyo might. Now hopefully
                            this gets rid of the question "Will Shampoo still be going after
                            Ranma after he marries Akane." Mousse is an Amazon and he clearly
                            states that Shampoo does not have to keep going after Ranma after
                            he is married and she is not going to die like some fan-fiction
                            says. Shampoo has to marry Ranma and she is going to go after him
                            until he is married. The thing is Shampoo is not going to show
                            Mousse any feelings directly unless Ranma and Akane marry which
                            they eventually do as Rumiko Takahashi says at the end of the
                            manga. Now there is still the question of why Shampoo would ever
                            go to Mousse. There have been many times when Shampoo has shown
                            Mousse care either subtly or outright. The first is in the 2nd of
                            the 3 fights Mousse officially has with Ranma. Shampoo takes
                            Mousse home and takes care of him as a duck and you can't take
                            away that fact even though she did tease Mousse and tie him up to
                            a table. The second time is when Shampoo beats him up in the
                            reversal jewel story. Shampoo beat Mousse to the ground just as
                            hard as she does Ranma when she had the jewel on. Shampoo
                            obviously had no control of her feelings and Shampoo could show
                            her feelings that were either on her sleeve or bottled up WAY down
                            inside of her. Shampoo could not show Mousse these feelings
                            because of the Amazon laws. Just a side note, Shampoo fans like to
                            say that this story proves that Ranma could learn to love Akane
                            which is just laughable. Ranma try's to get Shampoo to say he
                            loves her because Ranma is an EGOMANIAC. Ranma is willing to do
                            anything to make himself look like the best and if saying he loves
                            Shampoo will make himself look cooler then he will. He would have
                            done the same thing if it had been Akane or Ukyo. (Of course Ranma
                            never says he loves Shampoo). The third and maybe most critical
                            showing that Rumiko Takahashi shows these two get together is the
                            time Shampoo shows she cares in the invincible glasses story.
                            First of all Shampoo says to Akane that she does not care that
                            Mousse is acting bad because of the invincible glasses. Shampoo
                            says this but than we actually see Shampoo spying on Mousse and
                            than she confronts Mousse on top of a house. Shampoo actually
                            cries because Mousse says he will not stop using the invincible
                            glasses to beat Ranma. Now we as fans clearly know that Shampoo
                            does not have to marry Mousse because he used some cheap technique
                            like the glasses to beat Ranma. So why would Shampoo care? The
                            only logical reason is because Shampoo knows DEEP DOWN that if
                            Mousse had ANY chance of going out with and eventually marrying
                            her that Mousse could not be a coward, she just could not marry
                            someone like that. Shampoo even goes on a date with Mousse and
                            gets mad when the date does not go good and wanted it to be more
                            romantic. The 4th instance is the Two Shampoos story. Shampoo says
                            she could care less that Mousse is going out with the statues but
                            she does look worried right before she goes to watch television
                            and she does is obviously going to watch television to quell her
                            feelings on Mousse. Shampoo does not want to show Mousse feelings
                            and if she REALLY did not care about Mousse she would have just
                            stood there calling Mousse stupid and hanging on to Ranma. Shampoo
                            obviously did not want to see Mousse in this state or afraid if
                            she did she would start to care about Mousse. Shampoo also showed
                            that she really believed she thought Mousse would be fine. When
                            Akane made an order for Shampoo to deliver to the shrine where
                            Mousse is at she obviously understood that she was REALLY NEEDED.
                            And when Shampoo was REALLY needed she was there for Mousse. Not
                            only did she get a scarf but she gave Mousse Ranma's scarf. She
                            could have just given the statue something warm but she decides to
                            give him a scarf she was making for Ranma in front of Ranma.
                            Another instance here is when Mousse actually draws with Ranma in
                            his last battle with him. Ryouga and Mousse are Ranma's only true
                            rivals that are with him during the entire story. Ryouga in his
                            last fight with Ranma losses but Mousse draws after he gets
                            stronger by carrying the statue. What does this tell you? Mousse
                            can happily go back to China with Shampoo in the future and say he
                            drew with Ranma Saotome. Rumiko Takahashi made it a point for
                            Mousse to draw in Ranma's last battle with him unlike in Ryouga's
                            case where Ryouga lost because to get Shampoo Mousse would most
                            likely had needed to draw with Ranma while it doesn't matter with
                            Ryouga. The Three Years of smiling death just emphasized what fans
                            have known. Shampoo's conscience is bothering her after breaking
                            Mousse's glasses while washing them. Shampoo decides to be nice to
                            Mousse and all Shampoo really needed to do was apologize. Shampoo
                            maybe needed or wanted an outlet to be nice to Mousse. That's
                            about it for Shampoo showing she cares. Ill go onto different
                            points now. Shampoo in the Phoenix saga says she HATES Mousse and
                            that he makes her sick. But what some people don't seem to realize
                            is that Shampoo at that point was acting irrational. Shampoo was
                            for some insane reason says she and Ranma are going to die
                            together and Shampoo who is usually not completely idiotic shows
                            Ranma her eggs underneath her shirt. Besides this Rumiko Takahashi
                            decides to let Mousse do something very noble and not make Shampoo
                            her slave and instead give her, her own freedom. Shampoo doesn't
                            seem to care that Mousse did this but she knows what Mousse has
                            done and is probably afraid to give signs she likes Mousse so she
                            jumps at Ranma. Another note in the Phoenix saga is it shows the
                            diminished relationship between Shampoo and Ranma. Ranma says he
                            loves Akane in front of Shampoos face and all Shampoo says is that
                            Akane's a tough girl, while Ryouga decides to jump and hug Akane.
                            Now when Ranma and Akane are about to get married there are three
                            VERY important cameo scenes. The first shows Ryouga basically
                            forgetting about Akane and going after Akari, than Ukyo saying
                            she's going to solely work on okonomiyaki, and Mousse pouring out
                            his feelings and Shampoo obviously saying she understands and she
                            knew deep down what he's talking about which is basically her
                            giving up Ranma and going out with Mousse. Shampoo than tells
                            Mousse to make pork buns with him with a smile. Shampoo uses the
                            pork buns to attack Akane but you have to wonder why Rumiko
                            Takahashi made Shampoo and Mousse do something couples do together
                            at the end. Shampoo is NOT going to go with these "deep down"
                            feelings unless Ranma and Akane are COMPLETELY married which
                            Rumiko Takahashi says they eventually will be. Oh and two more
                            notes before I leave you. Cologne says in one way or another that
                            Shampoo likes Mousse two times in the manga and we all know how
                            much Cologne wants Ranma to marry Shampoo. So why would Cologne
                            encourage Mousse? Because lets face it Cologne sees there is
                            almost no chance between Shampoo and Ranma by the time she says
                            Shampoo likes Mousse. There is only one story centered around
                            Shampoo after the contrary jewel (the Pink and Link story) while
                            Mousse gets three separate stories all concentrating on him loving
                            Shampoo. Rumiko Takahashi is choosing to encourage Mousse's
                            relationship with Shampoo and lets face it if Rumiko Takahashi
                            encourages any relationship than its they are going to get
                            together. There are only three relationships she shows there is a
                            chance Ranma+Akane Ryoga+Akari and Shampoo+Mousse. All three
                            except Akane and Ranma have gone on dates where both do not have
                            some alternative motive. And these are the ONLY 4 who go on dates
                            as a DATE not something like wanting to get a powder to make you
                            into a man. The last thing I want to comment on is how Mousse
                            stays at the Cat Cafe. Why would Cologne and Shampoo harbor
                            someone that is an obstacle for Shampoo to get to Ranma. And
                            Mousse is not a slave or anything. Mousse gets paid, Mousse is not
                            locked up as a duck, Mousse gets fed, Shampoo does Mousse's
                            laundry, and Mousse gets time off. The other fact is as seen
                            between Ranma and Akane that living together does make love grow
                            even if there is none to start out with. Mousse is Shampoo all the
                            time and Mousse is obviously talking to her occasionally and there
                            relationship IS growing throughout the time Mousse stays with
                            them. There is flatly one reason Mousse is staying at the Cat Cafe
                            and I think it's mostly because of Cologne. After the Reversal
                            jewel story Cologne try's ABSOLUTELY nothing to put Shampoo and
                            Ranma together. Cologne at first try's EVERYTHING to put Ranma and
                            Shampoo together and by the end of the series try's nothing. If
                            Cologne sees a relationship between Mousse and Shampoo they are
                            obviously going to have a relationship because Cologne cares A LOT
                            about the Amazon tribe laws but sees that Ranma+Shampoo is
                            probably not going to happen and by the end of the series just
                            gives more hints that Shampoo must like Mousse. But let's face
                            something people nearing the end of the series Rumiko Takahashi
                            pushed Mousse's and Shampoo's relationship NOT Shampoo's and
                            Ranma's. And if Rumiko Takahashi did not want Shampoo and Mousse
                            to get together than she would NEVER have given us three more
                            Mousse stories and only 1 Shampoo story near the end of the
                            series. Rumiko Takahashi has obviously only given us three REAL
                            couples like it or not Ranma+Akane Ryoga+Akari and Shampoo+Mousse
                            She gives Ryoga+Akari and Shampoo+Mousse both a serious cameo and
                            again the only reason Shampoo decides to destroy Ranma's wedding
                            is out of last minute "I'm still an Amazon" desperation. But Ranma
                            and Akane ARE getting married and Shampoo will get to her "deep
                            down" senses and go with Mousse is basically what Rumiko Takahashi
                            is basically saying.
