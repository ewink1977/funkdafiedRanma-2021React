                        <p>Hi, my name is - Hi, my name is - Hi, my name is Erin Winking.</p>
                        <p>I was born April 22, 1977 in Springfield, Illinois. This is where I lived for around the first 
                        20 years of my life. While in high school, I went to the Capital Area Vocational Center where I 
                        learned about the internet and how to make web pages. It wasn’t that hard back in 1995… I did 
                        this for a while and started Image One Communications. Unfortunately, that business failed but I 
                        was not discouraged. I moved up to Minnesota where I attended Brown Institute for 1 1/2 years 
                        majoring in Broadcasting. This is where I learned about journalism and advertising. </p>
                        <p>I promptly dropped out before getting a degree, worked some miscellaneous jobs varying from armored 
                        car person to McDonald’s manager, before working as a television news photojournalist, which is what 
                        I have been doing since 2002. Right now, I live and work in Seattle(ish) and am working on moving 
                        into doing web development as a full time job!</p>
