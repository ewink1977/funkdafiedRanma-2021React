                        A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away - no wait it was this galaxy, and it really 
                        was not that long ago, a man named Genma Saotome got his freak on with a woman named 
                        Nodoka. Nine months later, as one tends to do, she had a baby. A boy surprisingly and 
                        conveniently named Ranma. If you need any more details about this, I suggest you shut 
                        down your computer or mobile device and go call your parents. You can do that 
                        right from your phone these days!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, Genma decided that if he allowed Ranma to be raised with his mother in the vicinity 
                        that Ranma would grow up to be a girly-man, as one tends to do because of having a mother. 
                        This is not the good kind of girly-man like Boy George, but the bad kind like George Michael. 
                        So, Genma took Ranma, and he went off into the wilderness to train.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now a little backtracking here, Genma and his good friend Soun Tendo came to the agreement 
                        that Ranma would marry one of Soun's daughters. This way the Anything Goes School of Martial 
                        Arts would continue long after the two were pushin' up daisies. Arranged marriages being the 
                        only way businesses pass between owners in Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back to the story at hand - Genma is wandering around Japan with Ranma. As Ranma gets older Genma 
                        teaches him all that he had learned from his master, Happosai. Ranma becomes a stronger and 
                        stronger martial artist. Soon Genma decides that they need a new way to train. So Genma, even 
                        though he does not speak a word of Chinese, drags Ranma off to China to train at the cursed 
                        training grounds of Jusenkyo. Well, of course the worst happens. Genma is kicked into the Spring 
                        of Drowned Panda. Now whenever he is splashed with cold water, he becomes a panda. Hot water 
                        reverses the effect. Ranma is now dumbfounded when he sees this panda jump out and because he is 
                        in such – quite reasonable - shock, he allows the panda to kick him into the Spring of Drowned 
                        Girl. Now Ranma changes into a girl when splashed with cold water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Backtracking again slightly - this dumbass kid, Ryouga Hibiki, who has no sense of direction, 
                        challenges Ranma to a fight in a yard behind Ryouga’s house. This was during a point when Ranma 
                        was attending school in Japan. (Yeah, I do not know when this was either, the anime kind of 
                        changes its mind every now and then on when Ranma and Genma left for China.) Ryouga ended up 
                        getting lost while trying to find the yard that was visible from his kitchen. Despite this, the 
                        ever-patient Ranma waited for him for three days. Eventually Ranma had to tinkle, or something 
                        happened and Ranma said ‘screw this’ and went home. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryouga finally arrives and sees that Ranma has left and of course, being the asshat that he is, 
                        declared that Ranma was the problem, not him. Ryouga finds out that Ranma and Genma went to China, 
                        so Ryouga, not one to realize that he is a moron, heads off to China after him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in China, Ranma is chasing his dad around. Genma is in panda form. Suddenly Ryouga appears out 
                        of nowhere. Genma-Panda comes flying over a hill and scares the living pumpkin seeds out of Ryouga. 
                        Ryouga ducks and the panda goes over him. Ryouga turns around and suddenly a red-haired girl flies 
                        over the same hill and kicks Ryouga off the cliff. Ryouga plummets into the Spring of Drowned Pig. 
                        Now he changes into a little black pig whenever he is splashed with cold water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a bit to present day. Ranma and Genma return to Japan from China. They head right over 
                        to the Tendo Dojo where Soun is waiting with his three daughters, Kasumi, Nabiki, and Akane. Soon 
                        after they arrive, they discover Ranma and Genma's curse. Kasumi and Nabiki volunteer Akane to be 
                        Ranma's fiancée because Akane hates boys (not in the cool lesbian way, but in the not so cool Rosie 
                        O'Donnell way - note, this <em>joke</em> is problematic on many levels, but I left it in just to show how
                        damned old this website is...) and since Ranma is only a half boy (GET IT?!?) they two of them will be a perfect match. 
                        This obviously is not true, but eventually the two of them fall in love and I assume get married 
                        and rock the Kazba, but this doesn't happen for a while, except on the internet.
                    </p>

                        At this point you should finish reading the website and enjoy it, then immediately go to Suncoast (ROFL) or someplace like that 
                        and buy the anime!
