                        <p>When Ranma was young – we’re talking like six years old - his father, Genma, thought it would be a good idea to teach Ranma the deadly 
                        'Cat Fist.' Unfortunately for Ranma, Genma declined to read both pages of instructions. The Cat Fist had been banned because it causes SEVERE 
                        psychological trauma to the student.</p>
                        <p>Here is how it works.</p>
                        <p>1 - Wrap the student in fish sausage and drop him into a pit of hungry cats.</p>
                        <p>That’s it. Apparently, somehow it teaches the student the mighty Cat Fist. Well, in this case it only caused Ranma to develop a fear of cats. 
                        (Hmm, incredibly young child being gnawed at by hundreds of starving cats - how could a phobia develop? I love cats and just the thought of that 
                        scares the crap out of me!)</p>
                        <p>To remedy this, Genma thought Ranma would get over his fear if he dealt with the cats some more. So Genma goes and wraps poor Ranma up in various 
                        other cat friendly items and chucks him into the pit repeatedly. Eventually Ranma learned the Cat Fist, but now he is mortified of cats. Even adorable 
                        ones like mine (Frisky! RIP dear kittah...), Luna, and even, I assume, sexy hot cat girls (though fearing Black Hanekawa is likely a good survival instinct).</p>
                        <p>Once Ranma’s fear of cats overwhelms him, he enters the Cat Fist state and basically becomes a cat. He’s an amazing fighter while in the state, though he has 
                        no real ‘human’ understanding of what is going on and when he leaves the Cat Fist state, he has no memories of what happened while he was a cat.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of leaving the Cat Fist state, it seems the only way he can do it is to have an old lady who is probably long dead by now lull him into a calm sleepy 
                        kitty, or Akane, because she seems like she will some day become an old Simpsons cat lady. Okay, I don’t know if that’s true, but neither do you!</p>
