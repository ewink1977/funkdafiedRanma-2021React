                        <p>"Hey Raye I have a thought is Serena". "What's It?. asked Raye. "Well how about all of us including Hotaru go for a walk 
                        to get some fresh air", said Serena. "That sounds like a good plan Serena" said the group at the same time. "Great I will go get 
                        Hotaru from her house" said Rini as she ran out of the Temple toward her friend's house. " Me and Hotaru will met you at the candy 
                        store everyone" sailor Rini as she disappeared out of Serena's sight.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile across the other side of Japan there was a loud yell as Akane was running at Ranma with her school bag trying to his 
                        him with it. "So the tomboy is mad at me again for nothing I did" said Ranma as he blocked Akane's school bag. "This is the last time 
                        i get in trouble with the teacher because of you and your father Ranma" said Akane as she ran after him once again. "Catch me if you 
                        can Akane", said Ranma as he ran in the other direction not seening a group of girls on the other side coming in view.</p>
                        <p>Back on the other side the girls were chatting as Rini and Hotaru were running up ahead. "Rini slow down" said Hotaru as she was 
                        trying to catch her breath. Hotaru out of breath grabbed on the rail of bridge and suddenly felt dizzy and fell forward into the water. 
                        "No Hotaru" yelled Rini as she looked over the rail to see her friend quickly drowning to the bottom of the lake. "Hold on Hotru" said 
                        Lita as she started to run to the lake ready to jump in but suddenly someone else jump in to save Hotaru. The person that come out of the 
                        lake trying to hold on to Hotaru. "Ranma grab my hand quickly", said Akane as she help Ranma (Female Form) out of the water with Ranma 
                        holding Hotaru over her shoulder. Seconds later Hotaru started to come to and opened her eyes. Hotaru looking around smiling as Ranma set

                        <p>"You ok Hotaru" asked Rini as she hugged her friend as tears fell down her face. "Yes I'm doing ok now, sorry i scared everyone" said Hotaru. 
                        Hotaru walked over to Ranma and bowed toward him and thanked her. "Here is the hot water Ranma" said Akane as he handed it to Ranma. "Now everyone
