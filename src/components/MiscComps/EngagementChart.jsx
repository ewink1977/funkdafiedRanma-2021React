                        <p>The engagement chart will give you the information you need to sort out (of the major players in the game) who is engaged to who, who is in love 
                        with who, why or how they got engaged and where they are registered! The chart is simple to read, and goes left to right. I used graphics, mostly because 
                        I like to make graphics. Note – I created this some time ago, and I am looking to update it and make it more interesting and more interactive. It’s one 
                        of the 12,871 things on my to do list!</p>

                        the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. In the first episode of the anime, Akane is picked because she doesn't like boys, according to her sisters, and 
                        since Ranma is only half boy (thanks to the curse) they would make the perfect match. In the beginning the two of them could not stand each other, but it 
                        has since become love. I don't care what anyone says. The chart does not lie.</p>

                        Ranma felt that if he kicked Shampoo's ass, he could legitimize his and Genma's scarfing of the food. Well, turns out that due to amazon law, Shampoo was now 
                        required to kill Ranma. After catching back up with him in Japan, Shampoo found out that Ranma was a guy, so now instead of having to kill him, she had to 
                        marry him. Confused? Me too, and I wrote it. (The paragraph, not the manga...)</p>

                        he was in his P-Chan form. He does not let Akane know that he is P-Chan because obviously she would stop letting him see her naked (mainly since she would 
                            kill him), and Akane can't figure it out because she's obviously a modern day Rainman, only without the savant part.</p>

                        fact that Shampoo wouldn't date/marry him. The fact that she is after Ranma now does not help that. So now Mousse feels that is he kicks Ranma's ass then 
                        Shampoo would fall madly in love with him. So that is how it works...</p>
                        <p className="e-para">There is some debate here, and I have changed things up from the original engagement chart to swing it from Shampoo HATING Mousse, to 
                        her only really, really disliking him. I explored the fact that she did have feelings for him in Moon Trek, and one of Funkdafied’s readers from back in the 
                        day, David Kim, sent me this <Link to="/engagementchart/kim-counterpoint/">COUNTERPOINT</Link> to my argument that Shampoo hates Mousse. Check it out!</p>
